    "they give you a copy of their database (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The database operates on **ingredient IDs**.\\\n",
    "It consists of a list of **fresh ingredient ID ranges**, a blank line, and a list of **available ingredient IDs**.\\\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "3-5\n",
    "10-14\n",
    "16-20\n",
    "12-18\n",

    "11\n",
    "17\n",
    "32\n",
    "```\n",

    "The fresh ID ranges are **inclusive**: the range `3-5` means that ingredient IDs `3`, `4`, and `5` are all **fresh**.\\\n",
    "The ranges can also **overlap**; an ingredient ID is fresh if it is in **any** range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves are trying to determine which of the **available ingredient IDs** are **fresh**.\\\n",
    "In this example, this is done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ingredient ID `1`is spoiled because it does not fall into any range.\n",
    "- Ingredient ID `5`is **fresh** because it falls into range `3-5`.\n",
    "- Ingredient ID `8`is spoiled.\n",
    "- Ingredient ID `11` is **fresh** because it falls into range `10-14`.\n",
    "- Ingredient ID `17` is **fresh** because it falls into range `16-20` as well as range `12-18`.\n",
    "- Ingredient ID `32` is spoiled.\n",
