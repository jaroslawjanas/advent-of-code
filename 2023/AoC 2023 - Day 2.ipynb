The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.\n","\n","The Elf explains that you've arrived at **Snow Island** and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here; would you like to play a game in the meantime?\n","\n","As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.\n","\n","To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.\n","\n","You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the `11` in `Game 11: ...`) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like `3 red, 5 green, 4 blue`).\n","\n","For example, the record of a few games might look like this:\n","\n","```\n","Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\n","Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\n","Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\n","Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\n","Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\n","```\n","\n","In _game 1_, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is _3 blue cubes_ and _4 red cubes_; the second set is _1 red cube_, _2 green cubes_, and _6 blue cubes_; the third set is only _2 green cubes_.\n","\n","The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained **only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes**?\n","\n","In the example above, _games 1_, _2_, and _5_ would have been **possible** if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, _game 3_ would have been **impossible** because at one point the Elf showed you _20 red cubes_ at once; similarly, _game 4_ would also have been **impossible** because the Elf showed you _15 blue cubes_ at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get **8**.\n","\n","Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.\n","\n","**What is the sum of the IDs of those games?**"],"metadata":{"id":"fLPC1VabZo4X"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##
