    "\"Our computers are having issues, so I have no idea if we have any Chief Historians in stock! You're welcome to check the warehouse, though,\" says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the *North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop*. The Historians head out to take a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shopkeeper turns to you. \"Any chance you can see why our computers are having issues again?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is **corrupted**. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like the goal of the program is just to **multiply some numbers**. It does that with instructions like `mul(X,Y)`, where `X` and `Y` are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, `mul(44,46)` multiplies 44 by 46 to get a result of `2024`. Similarly, `mul(123,4)` would multiply `123` by `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be **ignored**, even if they look like part of a mul instruction. Sequences like `mul(4*`, `mul(6,9!`, `?(12,34)`, or `mul ( 2 , 4 )` do **nothing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "`x`**`mul(2,4)`**`%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_`**`mul(5,5)`**`+mul(32,64]then(`**`mul(11,8)mul(8,5)`**`)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the four highlighted sections are real `mul` instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces **`161`** `(2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted mul instructions.\n",
    "**What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications?**"
